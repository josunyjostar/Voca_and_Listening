----------- 세상의 종말

How will the end of the world come upon us?
It's something I've always wondered about ever since I was a kid...
Well, it arrived without warning, in a way nobody could have imagined.
About 4 years ago, a man named Dr. Skinner, 
one of the most brilliant minds since Einstein, 
developed a miracle painkiller known as "Hapna."
Since it was cheap and had no side effects, 
it dominated the market instantly, 
and the world became a Hapna-filled wonderland.
They said it freed people from all suffering 
and was even celebrated as "the drug that could save the world."
Then, 3 years ago, Dr. Skinner vanished without a trace... 
And as it turned out... Hapna was a grand trap that he set upon us all.
