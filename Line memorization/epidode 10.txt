Such unusual guests we have today.
And who is it you are again?
It's been so long now that
I can't even remember your name.

Good day, Sister.
It's been quite some time.

There's nothing "good" about today, you pariah.

I've come here to humbly ask you for a favor.

Seriously?
You show up after four years
just to ask for favors?
What is it now?
Is it fraud? Maybe theft?
What do you want me to cover up for you now?
Father went out of his way
to get you admitted into a good school, 
and you did nothing but screw it up!

I quit smoking awhile back.
But then I figured there's no point in fighting the urge
when the world is about to end.

So, we're searching for Dr. Skinner right now.
Do you know if he underwent any type of heart surgery here?
I know you can't just share that information,
but it's our only clue that can lead us to Skinner's whereabouts.
Please help us!

On the day of your father's funeral,
you watched in secret, didn't you?
Off in a corner of the church
that nobody was paying attention to
But I had you figured out.

[Dramatic pause]
Even after that little brush with the law
and your estrangement from the Astor family,
I knew for a fact that you were a kind kid at heart.

[Dramatic pause]
I guess doctor-patient confidentiality means nothing now, huh?
Honestly, I've been waiting for someone to ask me about that.
After all...
I can't take this secret to my grave.

Skinner did undergo surgery for an artificial heart here.
And the post-op outlook was good.
But the problem is we can never be sure what might happen
with an artificial heart.

What are you implying?

All modern artificial hearts are designed
so that the heartbeat data can be constantly monitored.
Naturally, we were supposed to be in charge of monitoring Skinner's data.
But... after being discharged,
he immediately encrypted the transmission
and made it untraceable.
We no longer know his whereabouts
or even if he's still alive...

Leland, listen to me.
I know your father died in that disaster...
and I believe there's significance to the fact you survived it.
And you should also be aware
that your father talked about you pretty often, too.

What?

"He's the one who takes after me the most."
I can relate to him far more than he thinks,
since I always gave my parents a hard time, too.
I remember him saying that.

What's with the getup?

who is it you are again?

What kind of scheme are you up to this time?

Don't mention it. We scored big. 천만에 우린 큰 걸 얻었잖아.

Nobody gives a damn

What else was i supposed to do?

Your hunch was right on the money.

Is it just me or do we seem sorely out of place here? 
I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't be here for this.
