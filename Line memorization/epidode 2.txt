Three years ago, Hapna,
the painkiller that everybody said
would free humanity from suffering,
first hit the shelves.

But for me and my friends
it served an entirely different purpose.

We started using Hapna as a substitute for drugs.
We put it in our drinks...
it gave us a boost...
and got us a little high.

It was perfect for when you were feeling down,
everybody was using it.

Adults were scratching their heads,
"Why are kids drinking nothing but soda all the time?"

Hapna became a phenomenon,
it was available everywhere.
And on top of that, it was really cheap.

Nobody could ever imagine...
that in just three years,
it would become the terror that would kill us all.
I mean... I sure didn't.

-Just so you know,
It is impossible to take off.
We are also tracking your location at all times,
so there's no point in trying to escape.

-Oh, I see how it is...
Looks like you've assembled a team of bad apples, huh?

-I need a favor from you all.
Of course, I'm talking about finding Dr. Skinner faster than anyone else does.
Think about it.
You can choose to stay on the run as a fugitive,
or find Dr. Skinner and earn your freedom.
Which is more appealing?

-Huh?
-Hey!

-I see your threat and raise you another.
Now get this thing off my wrist, would'ja?

-I'm not falling for that trick again.
-If you try to remove it,
the wristband will get so hot that it will burn your hand off.
And just so you're aware...
You all will suffer the same consequences if anything bad happens to me.

-All right, fine...
I've always wanted to meet this Skinner guy, anyway.

-That's great.
Now everyone's on board.

Can you explain why the FDA approved a drug like this?

-Like I said 
-It's unprecedented for a drug to mutate into something else after three years...

-We're here live with one of Dr. Skinner's gardeners.
Who is going to shed some light on his secrets.
Sir, was there ever a time he looked suspicious to you...
or anything you can remember?

-Like I said earlier...
I'm just a gardener who tended to his plants...

-Or maybe you got the impression he was out of touch with regular people?

-Well, now that you mention it...

-Please, go on.

-So, Ms. Lisa...
I know that your newest album, "See You Later Alligator,"
is finally going to be released next month,
but it's been overshadowed by all the doomsday news.
Chances are that literally 
no one will listen to it by the time it comes out!

You may be right, but then...
that means nobody's going to be watching this ridiculous show, either!

-After a while, crocodile!

-So, what's the plan?
Say that we find Skinner.
There are a bunch of ways that we can leverage it in our favor.

-Leverage?

-You know... like keeping the vaccine all to ourselves.
Or selling it for a ton of money.

-I like the sound of that!

-Don't even start.
Listen up, everyone...

This team wasn't formed for personal gain or profit.

-Okay then, what's it for?

-Well...
We're here to save the world.

-Oh? So basically, we're superheroes.

-That's cool.
We're like the Avengers or something.

-Huh?

-In any case, Finding Skinner is the only thing that matters now.

-Okay...
I just need to know one thing.
Now don't be shy...
Has anybody here used Hapna?

-For the time being, this will be our base of operations.
And just so we're clear, I was against you joining us.

-Now why would you do that?

-People like you who run around showboating are nothing but a burden to the team.

I gotta say,
don't cha think this place a bit too rundown for us world-saving superheroes?

-It's a "vintage style" disguise.

-Hold out your hand,
it'll scan your vein pattern to unlock.

-Wow, I've already been registered...

-We did it while you were sleeping.

-This is Deniz Skinner, Born in Istanbul.
Assuming he's still alive, he would be 56 years old.
Lost both parents to local unrest at the age of 12.
He's remained alone ever since.
No wife, no kids.
-All alone in the world, literally.

-He enrolled at ETH Zurich when he was 16,
got into Cambridge at 20,
and while there made many significant accomplishments.

People were starting to call him the next Einstein...

-Question!
Shouldn't we be focused on other stuff,
like his personality or whatever else can give us insight into his motives?

Good point.

-Skinner was awarded the Nobel Prize three times,
but donated the money to charity.
He lived a very humble life...
Even going as far as to abandon the patents on the drugs that he developed.

-He was a passionate activist
who took part in protests advocating for peace and ending economic disparity.

He was also a strong proponent for climate change.
He attended many environmental summits
and the United Nations General Assembly,
where he would press countries to do more.

This speech here
was one of the most famous he gave at the UN.

-I am simply here as a scientist who is stating the facts.
According to my calculations, Precisely 3 years from now...
The ice in the North Pole will melt and be lost forever!
And that's only the beginning!

We must take action now or things will get out of control and the environment will collapse!

A thriving economy isn't going to help anyone when Earth becomes uninhabitable!

-Despite his efforts,
the speech ended with multiple countries of the UN withdrawing from the assembly.

Not long after that...
he vanished without a trace.

-Sounds like a pretty decent guy.

-Sounds too good to be true.
Maybe he was doing some really evil stuff.

Any eyewitness accounts of him online?

-Right. Nothing recent, but I did find a few things here.
He was seen giving his seat to an elderly woman on the train,
and helping out a homeless person...
And there was this time he tried to eat a sandwich, 
but then a stray dog took it away from him.

-He seems like an all around good person.
-The guy's practically a saint.
-Why would a respected man like this want to destroy the world?

-Regardless...
There has been no information on him since his disappearance three years ago.
It seems nobody has been able to locate him anywhere.

-So you want us to believe
he's been cooped up in some hideout this whole time?

-Maybe he's already dead.
-Or he could be wearing some kind of disguise.
-Or he might have assumed someone else's identity.
