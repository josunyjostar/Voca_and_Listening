-------------------- 삶의 요구

I wonder why is it that life always requires us to overcome 
so much grief, suffering, and all that other crap? 
Can't we just have fun and not have to deal with any of it? 
That's what was going through my head when first I heard about Hapna. 
So, obviously, I jumped on it. 
Some people said that it cured the pain of a heartbreak.
I thought, "That's weird." 
"How can a broken heart ever be painless?" 
"Isn't this too good to be true?" 
"What if I'm just being duped?" 
Those thoughts did cross my mind. 
Funny... It turns out that we were all being duped.

-Someone must be hacking the surveillance systems... 

Are they replacing all the faces with his? 

-Yes... and it's being done with precision. 
They've altered the polygon masks, as well as the thermal imaging. 

-So what are you saying? 
Skinner is the one behind all this? 

No way... 

I'm only aware of three hackers... 
that can pull off a task like this... 

-And who are they? 

-Popcorn Wizard... Doctor 909... and Mad Screamer. 
Oh... that last one... is me. 

-Seriously? 

-There's a strong possibility, one of the other two hackers is helping Skinner out. 

-Elaina, can you find them? 

-I'm on it. 

-The surveillance cameras are no longer an option. 
But this does give us one clue. 
If Skinner has undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, 
there would be no need to do all of this. 

Which means? 

-That he's still somewhere out there... 
with the same face. 

-Correct.

-We're from Smile Clean! 
-Yeah, and we're here to make Mr. Skinner's home squeaky clean! 

-Huh? Haven't you guys been watching the news? 
The owner of the house has gone missing! 

-Okay, but we were told we'd be paid up-front, so... 

-I don't care. 
I was told not to let anybody get inside! 

-All right then, sir. 
-We'll just have them send the invoice to the both of you. 

-Huh?!

Well, there's a cancellation fee if you send us back without doing our job... 
And just between us... it's actually a pretty hefty amount...

There sure is a lot of them out here. 
So, where's this lead of yours? 

-Guy's name is Jerry. 
Met him in prison, two stays ago. 
Now I hear he's the leader of this homeless community. 

What? 

You scared or something? 

-Absolutely not. 

You don't have to act all tough in front of me. 
Let's go. 

-Hey, guys, do you know anyone named Jerry? 
He's supposed to be in charge of things around here. 

-Jerry? No clue. 

-Excuse me. 
Do you know a man named Jerry? 

Hey, buddy. 
The guy you're talking to can't see anything. 
You're not one of us, are ya? 
Jill's the one who runs the show around this place. 

-Jill? 

-That's right. 
She's right behind you. 

-Oh, my gosh! Axel?! 
It's been forever! 
I'm so happy to see you! 
Just look at you! 
You haven't changed a bit! 

-Thanks! And look at you! 
You're a woman now, Jerry! 

-Yep! 
I go by Jill now!

-------------------- 교수 Claude 
So, what brings you here? 

-We're looking for a man named Claude. 
I was told he's been seen somewhere around this area recently. 

I'm a transgender woman with a record, who's also gone through bankruptcy. 
Around here, that's not an uncommon story. 
Some folks were happy to hear the world is ending... 
Even though you'll never hear them say it out loud. 
These people have circumstances that have led them here. 
So you have to understand that it's common courtesy not to go digging up anybody's past. 

-Well... 
Back when I was an academic researcher, a guy said to me... 
"There will never be a black Einstein." 
And that it was impossible for people like us to win a Nobel Prize... 
no matter how hard "we" tried. 
Unfortunately, I ended up hitting him... 
That man... was the dean of the university. 
I was kicked out of the academy for my actions, 
but Professor Claude stood up for me until the very end. 
And to this day... I have yet to thank him.

-You must be surprised. 
Seeing how I've hit rock bottom like this. 

-To be honest, I need your help. 
I'm looking for Skinner right now. 

-Ah, yes. Things are a real mess. 

-Do you happen to know where he might be? 

I haven't talked with that man for years. 
Little did I know, 
that humanity would one day be killed by the medicine he invented. 

Any information would help no matter how trivial. 

-I imagine that Skinner was someone who most people saw as an /honorable man. 
But he was obsessed... 
His research blinded him to everything around him, 
Including the time of day.
and that made him a nuisance to all the people he worked with... 
It was exhausting, and I knew I wouldn't able to keep up... 
So, I just cut all ties with him. 
But then as I watched him rise to prominence, it made me jealous. 
I desperately wanted to outdo him, 
To somehow leave my mark on the world. 
And that frustration drove me to falsify the results of my research. 
It lead to the university firing me... and that's how I ended up here.

I just remembered. 
This one time we got into a passionate discussion about baklava... 

-Baklava? 
Isn't that a middle eastern pastry? 

-Yes. 
Skinner told us that his Grandmother Belinda made the best baklava in the world. 
He raved on about how magical her recipe was, 
and that no one could ever make it the same way. 

-His grandmother? 

-As I remember... he mentioned she lived somewhere in Istanbul. 
But I couldn't tell you if she's still around now. 

-Thank you, Professor. 
And I appreciate you standing up for me back then.

You must be here to ask about my grandson. 
It's been years since I last saw him. 
It's not like I was keeping it a secret. 
It's just that no one ever bothered to ask me. 

-You see, he tragically lost both of his parents when he was little. 
So I stepped up to raise him in his mother's absence. 

-What was he like? 

-He was a normal little boy, and a kindhearted crybaby. 
Nothing unusual there. 
No matter the years... or the chaos he has caused... 
To me... he's still just the cute little grandson I raised.

-That's weird. 
I think I've seen this flower somewhere before. 

-Ah, that's right... That is something he brought for me. 
Apparently, it's a very rare variety of tulip that hardly blooms. 

-Do you remember the last time you talked to Skinner? 

-Let's see... about 3 years back. 
Yes. That's right.  He sent me a video message. 
Wait here a moment. 

-Hello, Belinda! 
How have you been? 
I've been pretty busy with work lately. 
I wanted to visit for Christmas and have your baklava, 
but it seems like I'm not going to be able to make it. 
Once things settle down, I promise I'll come home. 
So take good care of yourself until then. 
Bye for now. 

-I gotta say, that doesn't look like the kind of guy 
who would commit the world's worst massacre.
