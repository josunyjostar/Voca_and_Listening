-------------------- 삶의 요구

I wonder why is it that life always requires us to overcome 
so much grief, suffering, and all that other crap? 
Can't we just have fun and not have to deal with any of it? 
That's what was going through my head when first I heard about Hapna. 
So, obviously, I jumped on it. 
Some people said that it cured the pain of a heartbreak.
I thought, "That's weird." 
"How can a broken heart ever be painless?" 
"Isn't this too good to be true?" 
"What if I'm just being duped?" 
Those thoughts did cross my mind. 
Funny... It turns out that we were all being duped.

-We're looking for a man named Claude. 
I was told he's been seen somewhere around this area recently. 

I'm a transgender woman with a record, who's also gone through bankruptcy. 
Around here, that's not an uncommon story. 
Some folks were happy to hear the world is ending... 
Even though you'll never hear them say it out loud. 
These people have circumstances that have led them here. 
So you have to understand that it's common courtesy not to go digging up anybody's past. 

-Well... 
Back when I was an academic researcher, a guy said to me... 
"There will never be a black Einstein." 
And that it was impossible for people like us to win a Nobel Prize... 
no matter how hard "we" tried. 
Unfortunately, I ended up hitting him... 
That man... was the dean of the university. 
I was kicked out of the academy for my actions, 
but Professor Claude stood up for me until the very end. 
And to this day... I have yet to thank him.

-Someone must be hacking the surveillance systems... 

Are they replacing all the faces with his? 

-Yes... and it's being done with precision. 
They've altered the polygon masks, as well as the thermal imaging. 

-So what are you saying? 
Skinner is the one behind all this? 

No way... 

I'm only aware of three hackers... 
that can pull off a task like this... 

-And who are they? 

-Popcorn Wizard... Doctor 909... and Mad Screamer. 
Oh... that last one... is me. 

-Seriously? 

-There's a strong possibility, one of the other two hackers is helping Skinner out. 

-Elaina, can you find them? 

-I'm on it. 

-The surveillance cameras are no longer an option. 
But this does give us one clue. 
If Skinner has undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, 
there would be no need to do all of this. 

Which means? 

-That he's still somewhere out there... 
with the same face. 

-Correct.
