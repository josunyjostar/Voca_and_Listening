episode 4

-------------------- 하프나
-When Hapna went on sale 3 years ago,
minors were strictly
prohibited from using it.

But in the underground scene,
it was a craze among us kids.

Adults didn't understand why we
would want to use painkillers.

Then all it took was
a single rumor.
"Hapna is a drug
that can get rid of sadness."
The word spread like wildfire.
Dealers started selling it to us at jacked-up prices.

I took it, too.
Since my own feelings
were too much for me to handle.

It seemed crazy that Skinner found a way
to control human emotions.
I started to think of him as a god.

Needless to say, he betrayed all those expectations,
but just maybe...

-------------------- Dr. 909
-Dr. 909.
One of the world's most prolific hackers.
Even the FBI hasn't been able to identify him.
But thanks to Elaina,
we located his hidden wallet.

-What's a "hidden wallet"?

-Well, think of it like a bank ledger
for cryptocurrencies.
Looking into it, we found a
highly unusual influx of funds.

-Whoa! Is this for real?
-That's an insane amount of money.

-Right before Skinner made his announcement,
a stock trader named Sam
deposited a large amount of money into 909's account.
-From the looks of it,
the guy knew ahead of time
that Hapna stocks would plummet.
He sold off a whole bunch of them just before the news hit.

-But how could this guy know?

-Dr. Skinner's plan started 3 years ago,
when he disappeared and
erased all traces of himself.
It should be impossible
to pull that off without the help 
of a top-tier hacker.
-So, basically, this 909 guy helped Skinner disappear
in exchange for Hapna info.
Then got with Sam to cash in before the crash.
-That seems like the natural conclusion.

-Okay. All we gotta do now
is catch this 909 fella.

-You make it so sound easy.

-In the meantime,
Elaina is going to keep monitoring the wallet 
for any movement.
The rest of you
go and hunt down Sam.
It seems highly likely that he's
in regular contact with 909.

-------------------- 침투작전
-We're going to infiltrate
in two teams.
Obviously, we can't bring in any weapons.

Ladies, your mission is to catch Sam's eye
by putting on a show
and waiting for his personal invite.

If you manage to
establish contact with him,
lure him to a secluded area.

-What if he doesn't choose us?

-We switch to plan B.
We go kick his ass.

-There is no plan B.
This is his turf.
And the last thing
we want is for him to run off
because we caused a scene.

-------------------- Dr 909 / 샘 체포
-Famed investor Sam Stephenson
was arrested today
on charges of insider trading.

Police took him into custody
alongside a hacker known as Dr. 909,
real name Donald McDonald,
who is suspected of leaking the information.

-So, to put it plainly,
909 had no connections
with Skinner whatsoever?

-Yes, that seems to be the case.

-But at least now we're aware
that Delta Medicinal knew
the dangers of Hapna.
Which means that...

Those people definitely have
some connection to Skinner.
