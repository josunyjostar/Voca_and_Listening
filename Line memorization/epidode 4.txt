episode 4

-------------------- 하프나
-When Hapna went on sale 3 years ago,
minors were strictly
prohibited from using it.

But in the underground scene,
it was a craze among us kids.

Adults didn't understand why we
would want to use painkillers.

Then all it took was
a single rumor.
"Hapna is a drug
that can get rid of sadness."
The word spread like wildfire.
Dealers started selling it to us at jacked-up prices.

I took it, too.
Since my own feelings
were too much for me to handle.
나도 복용했다.
내 감정이 감당하기 너무 벅찼기 때문에.

It seemed crazy that Skinner found a way
to control human emotions.
I started to think of him as a god.

Needless to say, he betrayed all those expectations,
but just maybe...

-------------------- Dr. 909
-Dr. 909.
One of the world's most prolific hackers.
Even the FBI hasn't been able to identify him.
But thanks to Elaina,
we located his hidden wallet.

-What's a "hidden wallet"?

-Well, think of it like a bank ledger
for cryptocurrencies.
Looking into it, we found a
highly unusual influx of funds.

-Whoa! Is this for real?
-That's an insane amount of money.

-Right before Skinner made his announcement,
a stock trader named Sam
deposited a large amount of money into 909's account.
-From the looks of it,
the guy knew ahead of time
that Hapna stocks would plummet.
He sold off a whole bunch of them just before the news hit.

-But how could this guy know?

-Dr. Skinner's plan started 3 years ago,
when he disappeared and
erased all traces of himself.
It should be impossible
to pull that off without the help 
of a top-tier hacker.
-So, basically, this 909 guy helped Skinner disappear
in exchange for Hapna info.
Then got with Sam to cash in before the crash.
-That seems like the natural conclusion.

-Okay. All we gotta do now
is catch this 909 fella.

-You make it so sound easy.

-In the meantime,
Elaina is going to keep monitoring the wallet 
for any movement.
The rest of you
go and hunt down Sam.
It seems highly likely that he's
in regular contact with 909.
