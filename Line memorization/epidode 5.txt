-After Hapna hit the market,
the frenzy even spread through the prison I was in.
It was a real hassle to get your hands on it,
unless you were willing to pay a hefty price.

I'm not normally into drugs,
but I decided to try it out of curiosity.
The first thing I did was headbutt the bars of my cell.
It hurt like a bitch.

Guess the stuff has no effect on me.
And what's worse is that Hapna is lethal 
even if you've only taken it one time.

And now I'm stuck looking for this Skinner guy.
If we can't find him in time...
everybody dies.

So I guess I'll have to find him in Hell and kick his ass.

-So, 909 hacked into Delta Medicinal's database,
which is where he learned about the threat of Hapna.
More importantly,
Delta Medicinal was in charge of Hapna's clinical trials.

-Which means it's highly likely 
that Delta Medicinal knew exactly
how dangerous the drug was.

-And then, there's this image...

-Mm. What exactly are we looking at?

-It was among the files we took from 909.
I have no idea what it is.

-What if the company was conspiring with Skinner?
Then all the trials and approvals could've been faked.

-That's definitely a possibility.
The bottom line is
they must have some kind of connection to Skinner.

-How's it coming, Elaina? Have you found anything?

-I'm not seeing any data from the clinical trials.
However, I did come across something weird.
Someone at Delta Medicinal
has been uploading music from their servers weekly
to an audio site called SoundCloud.

-What's so strange about that?

-Yeah, it could have been a music-loving employee.

Check this out.

-What the hell is that?

-I'll admit it, this music sounds pretty weird.

-Hold on.
Elaina, can you open it as an image file instead?

-Let me try.

-Well, now...
-This is the clinical trial data for Hapna.

-You can tell?

-Huh? Yes, on a basic level.

-Hold on.
Why would they encode their trial data 
and then uploaded it to a social media site?

-Because they...
probably want it to reach a recipient who would like to remain hidden.

-Does that mean...?

-It's Skinner!

-All right. We've got plenty of dirt on them now.
Let's go say hello.
