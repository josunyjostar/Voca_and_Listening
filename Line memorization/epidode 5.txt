-After Hapna hit the market,
the frenzy even spread through the prison I was in.
It was a real hassle to get your hands on it,
unless you were willing to pay a hefty price.

I'm not normally into drugs,
but I decided to try it out of curiosity.
The first thing I did was headbutt the bars of my cell.
It hurt like a bitch.

Guess the stuff has no effect on me.
And what's worse is that Hapna is lethal 
even if you've only taken it one time.

And now I'm stuck looking for this Skinner guy.
If we can't find him in time...
everybody dies.

So I guess I'll have to find him in Hell and kick his ass.

-So, 909 hacked into Delta Medicinal's database,
which is where he learned about the threat of Hapna.
More importantly,
Delta Medicinal was in charge of Hapna's clinical trials.

-Which means it's highly likely 
that Delta Medicinal knew exactly
how dangerous the drug was.

-And then, there's this image...

-Mm. What exactly are we looking at?

-It was among the files we took from 909.
I have no idea what it is.

-What if the company was conspiring with Skinner?
Then all the trials and approvals could've been faked.

-That's definitely a possibility.
The bottom line is
they must have some kind of connection to Skinner.

-How's it coming, Elaina? Have you found anything?

-I'm not seeing any data from the clinical trials.
However, I did come across something weird.
Someone at Delta Medicinal
has been uploading music from their servers weekly
to an audio site called SoundCloud.

-What's so strange about that?

-Yeah, it could have been a music-loving employee.

Check this out.

-What the hell is that?

-I'll admit it, this music sounds pretty weird.

-Hold on.
Elaina, can you open it as an image file instead?

-Let me try.

-Well, now...
-This is the clinical trial data for Hapna.

-You can tell?

-Huh? Yes, on a basic level.

-Hold on.
Why would they encode their trial data 
and then uploaded it to a social media site?

-Because they...
probably want it to reach a recipient who would like to remain hidden.

-Does that mean...?

-It's Skinner!

-All right. We've got plenty of dirt on them now.
Let's go say hello.

Nobody is more desperate to find out where he is than I am.
We were never made privy to his location,
and didn't have a way to contact him.
Which is why we had to go through such a hassle just to send the data.

-Did you know Hapna would mutate and become toxic?

-We had absolutely no idea!
How could that have possibly benefited us?

-Have you determined that it's actually lethal?

-Before we did any human trials,
we tested its effects on monkeys.
-And one of those subjects...
died just the other day.

Its eyes became discolored,
taking on a pattern that looks like a starry-night.
Humans will be the next to go through it.

-Can't you develop an antidote?

-We've poured all of our resources into doing just that,
but even the R&D team doesn't know what to do.
I swear, Skinner is the devil incarnate...

-Well, if he's the devil,
then I suppose that makes us the angels that are going to kick his ass back to Hell.
I'm sick and tired of chasing after Skinner.
Let's lure the devil out.

------ 스키너 유인 작전 fake conference
-An announcement from Delta Medicinal regarding an emergency conference 
on the cure for Hapna?
This invitation, it was sent to all renowned doctors and researchers?

-Correct. Once Skinner learns
someone has developed the antidote to his creation,
he will almost certainly come to see if it's true.

-In other words, you've set up a fake conference.
You're going to lure Skinner out 
and catch him when he shows up?

-That's the plan.

-The committee will be holding their inquiry soon.
You heard about that, right?

-Yes. We need to show progress by then.
Otherwise, we'll be at a huge disadvantage.

-Indeed.
And at this point, 
we cannot afford to let it get swept under the rug.

-Do you think he'll actually show up?

-At the very least, 
he'll use a hacker to try and find out what's going on inside.

-You wanna bet the man himself will appear?
-Aw, hell yeah. I'm waiting for you, Skinnerbaby.

-Nice! This looks like the real thing.

-Each of one those vials 
has a built-in GPS tracker 
just in case anyone tries to steal them from us.

-What's inside of them?

-Just saline solution.

-The question is how will they try to get in?

-They may try and break in from the outside.
Or possibly...
-They sneak in by pretending to be an invited guest.

---
-Our private security firm has gone through the building 
and performed a full sweep, 
checking for bugs and wiretaps.

-There are 50 guards including myself.
At this moment, we are on high alert.
We have screened our entire staff
and they have had background checks.
So there should be no opportunities for Skinner to plant a spy among us.

-Let's say, we get his attention.
If his hacker gets in the system 
and finds out we're lying, what then?

-That's where Elaina comes in.

-Delta Medicinal has two different types of in-house networks.
One is the core Network for handling confidential information,
then a basic network for managing all essential building functions.
-The core network, which is located here,
is isolated from all other connections.
The wall is shielded
so no wireless signals can get through.
-Smart phones won't work, either,
so use this direct line if you need to contact me.

-All right. Looks like it's impossible to hack the core network.

-Isn't this a bit over the top?
-Won't the hacker just give up if we make things this difficult?

-No. The harder the security, the more they want to crack it.
Hackers can't resist.
-Besides, I've baited them by leaving the basic network accessible from the outside.

-So that's where we'll catch our hacker.

-Things are about to get started.
Keep yourselves alert.

-Bring it on, Skinner.
Let's paint the town red.

-Are you feeling better now, Mr. President?

-Yeah. I'm sorry to worry you.
I fell into a deep depression 
because Skinner seemed like the devil to me.
But these guys told me that we have to fight back, 
no matter what.
- And I agreed to follow through with that advice.
I had just forgotten how to put up a good fight.
I had the best sleep in ages last night.

-In case things went south,
I planted a fake antidote file on the core computer for them to steal.
We can locate Popcorn Wizard with it.

-Losing the battle to win the war. Huh.

-But the core network is still under their control, so be careful.

-Found them.
They're at the Islamabad stock exchange in Pakistan!

-I'll put in a call to have the local authorities search the place.

-Every country's stock exchange 
has specially fortified network infrastructures.
If tapped into, 
there's enough bandwidth 
for hackers to conduct massive cyberattacks.
