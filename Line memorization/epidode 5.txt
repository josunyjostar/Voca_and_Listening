-After Hapna hit the market,
the frenzy even spread through the prison I was in.
It was a real hassle to get your hands on it,
unless you were willing to pay a hefty price.

I'm not normally into drugs,
but I decided to try it out of curiosity.
The first thing I did was headbutt the bars of my cell.
It hurt like a bitch.

Guess the stuff has no effect on me.
And what's worse is that Hapna is lethal 
even if you've only taken it one time.

And now I'm stuck looking for this Skinner guy.
If we can't find him in time...
everybody dies.

So I guess I'll have to find him in Hell and kick his ass.

-So, 909 hacked into Delta Medicinal's database,
which is where he learned about the threat of Hapna.
More importantly,
Delta Medicinal was in charge of Hapna's clinical trials.

-Which means it's highly likely 
that Delta Medicinal knew exactly
how dangerous the drug was.

-And then, there's this image...

-Mm. What exactly are we looking at?

-It was among the files we took from 909.
I have no idea what it is.

-What if the company was conspiring with Skinner?
Then all the trials and approvals could've been faked.

-That's definitely a possibility.
The bottom line is
they must have some kind of connection to Skinner.

-How's it coming, Elaina? Have you found anything?

-I'm not seeing any data from the clinical trials.
However, I did come across something weird.
Someone at Delta Medicinal
has been uploading music from their servers weekly
to an audio site called SoundCloud.

-What's so strange about that?

-Yeah, it could have been a music-loving employee.

Check this out.

-What the hell is that?

-I'll admit it, this music sounds pretty weird.

-Hold on.
Elaina, can you open it as an image file instead?

-Let me try.

-Well, now...
-This is the clinical trial data for Hapna.

-You can tell?

-Huh? Yes, on a basic level.

-Hold on.
Why would they encode their trial data 
and then uploaded it to a social media site?

-Because they...
probably want it to reach a recipient who would like to remain hidden.

-Does that mean...?

-It's Skinner!

-All right. We've got plenty of dirt on them now.
Let's go say hello.

Nobody is more desperate to find out where he is than I am.
We were never made privy to his location,
and didn't have a way to contact him.
Which is why we had to go through such a hassle just to send the data.

-Did you know Hapna would mutate and become toxic?

-We had absolutely no idea!
How could that have possibly benefited us?

-Have you determined that it's actually lethal?

-Before we did any human trials,
we tested its effects on monkeys.
-And one of those subjects...
died just the other day.

Its eyes became discolored,
taking on a pattern that looks like a starry-night.
Humans will be the next to go through it.

-Can't you develop an antidote?

-We've poured all of our resources into doing just that,
but even the R&D team doesn't know what to do.
I swear, Skinner is the devil incarnate...

-Well, if he's the devil,
then I suppose that makes us the angels that are going to kick his ass back to Hell.
I'm sick and tired of chasing after Skinner.
Let's lure the devil out.

-An announcement from Delta Medicinal regarding an emergency conference 
on the cure for Hapna?
This invitation, it was sent to all renowned doctors and researchers?

-Correct. Once Skinner learns
someone has developed the antidote to his creation,
he will almost certainly come to see if it's true.

-In other words, you've set up a fake conference.
You're going to lure Skinner out 
and catch him when he shows up?

-That's the plan.

-The committee will be holding their inquiry soon.
You heard about that, right?

-Yes. We need to show progress by then.
Otherwise, we'll be at a huge disadvantage.

-Indeed.
And at this point, 
we cannot afford to let it get swept under the rug.
