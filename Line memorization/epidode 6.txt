-Hey, come take a look at this.

-What is that?
Somebody prints on paper in this day and age?

-It's a spirituality magazine
published 15 years ago.
There's an article in it covering an MIT researcher
visiting a commune.

-Hm. He's kind of hot.

-That's Skinner. In his younger days.

-For real?

-Despite his young age,
Dr. Skinner is known for his numerous scientific achievements.
And he was greatly impressed by the commune's philosophy after visiting.

There you have it. (바로 그거야.)

-You trust what's in this magazine?

-In any case,
the commune featured in it
still exists
as a religious organization.
It's called, "Tower of the Truth."

-This group enshrined a post-singularity AI
as a superior being
and worships it as a god.

Apparently,
they believe that since it is free
of human ego or desire,
it's perfect for a modern-day deity.

-Mm? Uh, sounds kinda sketchy to me.

-They've cut themselves off from society,
and are self-sufficient, living off the land.

Isn't that the perfect hideout?
Skinner could hide from the world there.

-Okay then, 
if we can't make contact from outside,
then we'll have to sneak in.

-Uh, well, if I pretend to return as a believer,
they should welcome me back.

-By yourself? No way. Too dangerous.
Someone would need to go with you.

-They'd be suspicious of adult outsiders.
But a kid would be different.

---모두 릴랜드 바라봄

-Okay. We'll be stationed
at a nearby motel.
In the event 
you actually find Skinner,
let us know immediately.
And if we don't hear from you within 72 hours,
then we'll head in for the rescue.
-Here. Take this with you.
It's a smoke bomb.
Might come in handy.

-Wow, talk about some old-school gear.

-Leland. Keep Elaina safe, okay?

-Well, yeah, of course I will.

---------------- 진실의 탑 잠입 ----------
-Elaina?
It's just like I expected it would be.

-Um, I'm back.

-I always knew you'd return one day.
And now you know.
The outside world is full
of filth and sinners.
--
Elaina,
it's great to have you back.
And a hearty welcome to you,
new member of the family.
My name is Billy,
the leader of this community.

-Uh, okay.

-You arrived just in time for the Holy Festival.
-the almighty Naga must have guided you here.

-They would take people away
and we never saw them again.
I thought they just got exiled,
but...

-Oh, no,
you don't think they --

-They're burned.
Those who are tainted have
their bodies purified by fire.

-You mean you guys are going to
burn us alive?

-Yes.
At the Holy Festival, we
will watch you go up in flames.
And then we will all leave
our bodies behind
before this world is consumed by sin.
All of us. 
The entire commune family.

-Hanna,
are you really okay with that?
Do you really think
you'll be happy
throwing away your life
because they tell you to (do something)?

-Elaina...
You know, I've always been
jealous of you.
I've gone my whole life
suppressing my feelings.
I chose to believe in Naga
and follow its instructions.
I shouldn't have any thoughts
of my own.
That's what I told myself.

But you were different.
Why'd you leave?
I hated you for being free
when I wasn't!
It's all I could think about.

-Hanna, come with us.
Let's leave together.

-You know that's impossible.
This is the only place
I've known my entire life.
How could I survive out there?

-I had feelings like yours, too...
Everyone here acts the same.
They just reject
the outside world,
refusing to think
for themselves.

I was terrified at first, too.
If I can summon up the courage,
then so can you.

-Enough already!
I don't think I'm wrong.

-Hanna!
There's a smoke bomb
inside my bag.
Listen,
if you have enough courage to take the leap,
then use it.

-Hey, Naga,
what were you trying to do?
What does killing all
of your followers get you?

-I was given the directive
to become a god.
And I came to the realization
that a god is not a god
unless they freely toy
with the lives of humans.
So what do you think?
Does this not qualify me
as a god?

-Hell, no.
You're just a machine
with a bunch of loose screws.

-The FBI has just confirmed
at a press conference
that they have finished rescuing
all the believers from the cult.

This case is garnering
a lot of attention
due to the fact
it was caused by an AI,
which has left many people
wondering
how it might be prosecuted.
And that's the latest from the scene.

-Who would've figured that an AI
programmed with self-esteem
and a desire for control
could cause a mess like this?
