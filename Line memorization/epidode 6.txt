-Hey, come take a look at this.

-What is that?
Somebody prints on paper in this day and age?

-It's a spirituality magazine
published 15 years ago.
There's an article in it covering an MIT researcher
visiting a commune.

-Hm. He's kind of hot.

-That's Skinner. In his younger days.

-For real?

-Despite his young age,
Dr. Skinner is known for his numerous scientific achievements.
And he was greatly impressed by the commune's philosophy after visiting.

There you have it. (바로 그거야.)

-You trust what's in this magazine?

-In any case,
the commune featured in it
still exists
as a religious organization.
It's called, "Tower of the Truth."

-This group enshrined a post-singularity AI
as a superior being
and worships it as a god.

Apparently,
they believe that since it is free
of human ego or desire,
it's perfect for a modern-day deity.

-Mm? Uh, sounds kinda sketchy to me.

-They've cut themselves off from society,
and are self-sufficient, living off the land.

Isn't that the perfect hideout?
Skinner could hide from the world there.
