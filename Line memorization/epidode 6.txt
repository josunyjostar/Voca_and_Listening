-Hey, come take a look at this.

-What is that?
Somebody prints on paper in this day and age?

-It's a spirituality magazine
published 15 years ago.
There's an article in it covering an MIT researcher
visiting a commune.

-Hm. He's kind of hot.

-That's Skinner. In his younger days.

-For real?

-Despite his young age,
Dr. Skinner is known for his numerous scientific achievements.
And he was greatly impressed by the commune's philosophy after visiting.

There you have it. (바로 그거야.)

-You trust what's in this magazine?

-In any case,
the commune featured in it
still exists
as a religious organization.
It's called, "Tower of the Truth."

-This group enshrined a post-singularity AI
as a superior being
and worships it as a god.

Apparently,
they believe that since it is free
of human ego or desire,
it's perfect for a modern-day deity.

-Mm? Uh, sounds kinda sketchy to me.

-They've cut themselves off from society,
and are self-sufficient, living off the land.

Isn't that the perfect hideout?
Skinner could hide from the world there.

-Okay then, 
if we can't make contact from outside,
then we'll have to sneak in.

-Uh, well, if I pretend to return as a believer,
they should welcome me back.

-By yourself? No way. Too dangerous.
Someone would need to go with you.

-They'd be suspicious of adult outsiders.
But a kid would be different.

-Okay. We'll be stationed
at a nearby motel.
In the event 
you actually find Skinner,
let us know immediately.
And if we don't hear from you within 72 hours,
then we'll head in for the rescue.
-Here. Take this with you.
It's a smoke bomb.
Might come in handy.

-Wow, talk about some old-school gear.

-Leland. Keep Elaina safe, okay?

-Well, yeah, of course I will.

-Elaina?
It's just like
I expected it would be.

-Um, I'm back.

-I always knew you'd return one day.
And now you know.
The outside world is full
of filth and sinners.
--
Elaina,
it's great to have you back.
And a hearty welcome to you,
new member of the family.
My name is Billy,
the leader of this community.

-Uh, okay.

-You arrived just in time  for the Holy Festival.
-the almighty Naga must have guided you here.
