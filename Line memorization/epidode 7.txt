---------나이 이야기

-Okay, so how old are you, Chris? Maybe 30?
-Don't be stupid, I am not that old.
-Then 26 or 27?
-Nope. No comment.
Anything I say is just gonna let you narrow it down.
-You paused there for a second.
-That means he's probably right.
-I guess I better start using "ma'am" around you.
-Don't even think about it.
-Since we're sharing, I'm 16 years old.
-God, could you be any more annoying?
-Ow, ow. Cut it out.

-Earlier today, 
the very last ice floe 
in the Arctic 
broke apart.

-Wow, 
so the North Pole's finally gone for good?

-It's all over the news right now.

-Check this out. 
This video is going viral.

-According to my calculations, 
precisely 3 years from now, 
the ice in the North Pole 
will melt and be lost forever.

-It's been 3 years to the day 
since he made that speech.

-For real?

-So then everything is playing out as Skinner predicted.

-Some people are even starting to treat him like a prophet or a God.

-But they were just calling him a terrorist the other day.

-Forget terrorism.
It's possible this entire thing could escalate into World War III.

-And now it looks like Hapna is old news.

-Yeah, you said it. 
If Skinner's telling the truth,
there's only 15 days left 
until the first deaths occur...

-Ya'know, 
a world war might wipe out humanity before Hapna does.

-Sorry I'm late. Let's get started.
Sadly, we're back to square one.
Even the FBI agents 
who raided that cult, 
the Tower of the Truth, 
couldn't find anything tied to Skinner.
Very unfortunate.
Their deity, Naga, 
was indeed an AI modeled after Skinner's brain, 
but the bureau concluded
that the man himself 
wasn't involved in any way.

-So, all that for nothing.

-Okay, then, what do we do now?

-In times like these, 
it's best to go back to where we began.

-What do you mean?

-First off, 
we should take another look at Skinner's video.

-Nor do I intend to unilaterally decide 
what the fate of humanity will be.
(나는 인류의 운명을 일방적으로 결정할 의도도 없습니다.)
All I am doing 
is serving as the Seventh Trumpeter.
(제가 하는 일은 단지 일곱 번째 나팔수 역할을 할 뿐입니다.)

-Wait, pause it. What's he mean?
(잠깐, 멈춰. 그게 무슨 뜻이야?)
What is the seventh trumpeter?
(일곱 번째 나팔수가 뭐야?)

-It's part of the New Testament.
(그건 신약성서의 일부야.)
John, one of the apostles of Jesus, 
was given a vision of the future by God 
which he wrote about in the Book of Revelation.
(예수의 사도 중 한 명인 요한은 하나님으로부터 미래의 환상을 받았고, 그것을 요한계시록에 기록했어.)

-What's supposed to happen?
(무슨 일이 일어난다고?)

-Volcanic eruptions, meteor storms, and war.
(화산 폭발, 유성 폭풍, 그리고 전쟁.)

In the Book of Revelation, 
God, enraged by humanity's arrogance, 
brings down all sorts of disasters on them.
(요한계시록에서 하나님은 인간의 오만함에 분노해 모든 종류의 재앙을 내리십니다.)

-Yikes.
(이런.)
-Sounds like what's happening to us now.
(지금 우리에게 일어나고 있는 것 같네.)

-Angels each sound their trumpet 
warning of the next calamity. 
And then, 
after the seventh angel blows its trumpet, 
final judgment gets delivered upon humanity.
(천사들이 각각 나팔을 불며 다음 재앙을 경고합니다. 그리고 일곱 번째 천사가 나팔을 불면, 인류에게 최후의 심판이 내려집니다.)

-Ah, that makes sense.
(아, 그렇군.)

-So that's why Skinner said he's blowing the seventh trumpet.
(그래서 스키너가 일곱 번째 나팔을 분다고 말한 거야.)
