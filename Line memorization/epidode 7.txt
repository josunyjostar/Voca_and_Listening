---------나이 이야기

-Okay, so how old are you, Chris? Maybe 30?
-Don't be stupid, I am not that old.
-Then 26 or 27?
-Nope. No comment.
Anything I say is just gonna let you narrow it down.
-You paused there for a second.
-That means he's probably right.
-I guess I better start using "ma'am" around you.
-Don't even think about it.
-Since we're sharing, I'm 16 years old.
-God, could you be any more annoying?
-Ow, ow. Cut it out.

-Earlier today, 
the very last ice floe 
in the Arctic 
broke apart.

-Wow, 
so the North Pole's finally gone for good?

-It's all over the news right now.

-Check this out. 
This video is going viral.

-According to my calculations, 
precisely 3 years from now, 
the ice in the North Pole 
will melt and be lost forever.

-It's been 3 years to the day 
since he made that speech.

-For real?

-So then everything is playing out as Skinner predicted.

-Some people are even starting to treat him like a prophet or a God.

-But they were just calling him a terrorist the other day.

-Forget terrorism.
It's possible this entire thing could escalate into World War III.

-And now it looks like Hapna is old news.

-Yeah, you said it. 
If Skinner's telling the truth,
there's only 15 days left 
until the first deaths occur...

-Ya'know, 
a world war might wipe out humanity before Hapna does.

-Sorry I'm late. Let's get started.
Sadly, we're back to square one.
Even the FBI agents 
who raided that cult, 
the Tower of the Truth, 
couldn't find anything tied to Skinner.
Very unfortunate.
Their deity, Naga, 
was indeed an AI modeled after Skinner's brain, 
but the bureau concluded
that the man himself 
wasn't involved in any way.

-So, all that for nothing.

-Okay, then, what do we do now?

-In times like these, 
it's best to go back to where we began.

-What do you mean?

-First off, 
we should take another look at Skinner's video.

-Nor do I intend to unilaterally decide 
what the fate of humanity will be.
All I am doing 
is serving as the Seventh Trumpeter.

-Wait, pause it. What's he mean?
What is the seventh trumpeter?

-It's part of the New Testament.
John, one of the apostles of Jesus, 
was given a vision of the future by God 
which he wrote about in the Book of Revelation.

-What's supposed to happen?

-Volcanic eruptions, meteor storms, and war.
In the Book of Revelation, 
God, enraged by humanity's arrogance, 
brings down all sorts of disasters on them.

-Sounds like what's happening to us now.

-Angels each sound their trumpet 
warning of the next calamity. 
And then, 
after the seventh angel blows its trumpet, 
final judgment gets delivered upon humanity.

-Ah, that makes sense.

-So that's why Skinner said he's blowing the seventh trumpet.

-What are the odds 
that Skinner is hiding in 
one of those 4 locations?

-It's hard to say why he would be there, 
But I'm sure 
there must be some sort of reason 
that he purchased all of that land.

-Sounds interesting.

-The only problem is 
that the islands are now submerged 
because of global warming.
So we don't have that many clues to follow.

-Understood.
And while I have you, 
do you have time to meet me for coffee?

-How interesting. 
I didn't know you liked Rembrandt.
Or maybe
you just wanted to come to a place 
that hasn't been bugged?

-Not at all.
I want to appreciate Rembrandt's artwork 
one last time before the end of the world.

-That's very sentimental.

-I'm just that kind of guy.

-The same guy everyone sees as a coldhearted pragmatist 
and who actually might be an AI 
instead of a regular human being?

-First time I've heard that.

-Hey, guys, 
this is completely unrelated, but...
is Lazarus going to get disbanded 
after we find Skinner?

-Of course. 
That's the sole purpose of our team.

-I was just thinking... 
that would be kind of a shame, you know?

-And? 
Are you saying 
we're better off not catching Skinner?

-Sounds like you would rather see 
the end of the world.

-No, that's not what I meant.
I just...

♪♪

I gotta say, 
I totally forgot 
how blue the sky and sea are.

-Yeah, 
I don't remember the last time I saw a clear sky.

-That's because Babylonia City is always cloudy.

-It's like that everywhere these days.

-The only beautiful places left
 are those without humans.

-You know, 
maybe this is something 
Skinner wanted us to see.

It's been 10 years now.
Everybody here packed up and moved to another island.

(뱃사람 다친걸 악셀이 알게 됨)
-Oh? What happened there?

-Oh, a bunch of flying fish jumped out,
 and one of them hit me.

-Wow. Sounds like it hurts.

-Not one bit.
It's an insensitivity disorder.
I was born with it.
-It makes me unable to feel pain, 
so I don't know what it's like.

-Oh, wow. 
So you've never taken Hapna?

-I never had a need to take it.
Cases like mine aren't uncommon around here.
It's called analgesia.
----------------------- 가라앉는 섬 사람들 통각결핍 -----------------
--------------------------- 통각 결핍 보고 -----------------------
-What's up?

-I just found out 
a majority of the people who lived on this island 
suffer from analgesia.

-Really?

-Yeah, my guide is actually a former resident.
He can't feel pain at all.
And guess what. 
When he was little, 
he remembers Skinner coming to visit the island.

-In the past, we didn't have any money.
It was impossible for us to move elsewhere.
But then Mr. Skinner swooped in and 
bought our entire island from us.
So thanks to him, 
we had enough money to start new lives.

-Elaina, can you trace where the money 
that he spent on the other islands went?

-I'll try.

-Rembrandt is the painter 
that many regard to be the master of light.
In other words, 
he understood that the true nature of things 
depended heavily on how they are illuminated.
He practically revolutionized the world of art.

-Okay then, 
what is so important 
that you had to bring me here to talk?

-I believe that 
I owe you an apology.

-What for?

-Because I know how you feel about Skinner, 
and it's not a stretch to say 
that I've taken advantage of that fact.

-Don't worry about it. 
No one forced me to do anything.
I made my own decisions.

-Of course, Doctor.

-Why did he start this whole thing?
And why did he leave me behind?
I need the answers to those questions.

-About the prison in Arizona.
The intelligence branch of the army has started sniffing around.

-For Axel?

-Yeah. Plus, 
they're looking into the incident at the Schiphol Airport.

-Axel is the one. 
He can shed light on everything.

-"The Raising of Lazarus."

-Tell me something, Dr. Hersch.
Do you somehow get the impression 
that Dr. Skinner sold his soul to the devil 
and became a different person?

-No, I don't.
I don't think he's changed at all.
He's always been very sincere. 
Practically to a fault.
But you can't survive in the world like that.
And when I told him as much, he replied,
(그리고 내가 그렇게 말했을 때, 그는 대답했어요,)
"What exactly is so wrong about a scientist who is sincere and pure?"

-Indeed.

-Here's what I can say for sure.
He wants somebody to search for him and find him

-Of course, I'd like to believe that, too.
