episode 8 
------------ 허쉬 추궁 ------------
So, uh, it's feeling very gloomy in here.
Where's Chris, by the way?

I have something to tell you about her.

Before you start, we need to talk.
Skinner developed Hapna at the Hague Institute,
which we know has been shut down.
But I had Elaina do a little digging.
I wanted to see who worked there at the time.

Huh? Is that Ms. Hersch?

Well, look at that,
guess that means you and Skinner were old buddies, eh?

So, ma'am, is there a good explanation for this
that you can share with us?

Very well then.
I knew somebody would uncover this information sooner or later.
Yes, it's true that I was once Skinner's colleague at the Hague.
I was also part of the team researching Hapna.
But right before the drug was finished,
he vanished without a trace.
He just left.
He never said a word to me or any of our colleagues.
I was totally devastated.
I left the institution shortly after.
Then three years later, when he finally returned from seclusion,
Hapna had become a lethal drug
that threatened to destroy the world.
Worse yet, we couldn't understand its molecular makeup.

And now?
Who are you working for?

Well, I bet you have an educated guess.

Yes, I do.
Some special task force created under the NSA...
I would assume.

That's correct.
Lazarus recruited me because of...
how well I know Skinner.

Excuse me.
I haven't been able to follow a single thing
you guys are saying.
Can we go back to Chris.
Where is she?
------------ 허쉬 추궁 ------------
------------ 크리스 연락 끊김 ----------
We lost communication with Chris last night.
Her GPS shows her in territorial waters in Russia near the Arctic, 
at an abandoned offshore oil rig.

She's in the Arctic?
Why would she be there?

We're working on the assumption
that the oil rig is part of Russia's spy network
and serves as one of their hideouts.

In other words, she's been captured by Russian agents.

If she remains out of contact for three days,
her wristband will automatically activate
to stop her bloodstream and end her life.
It was set up that way because that's what she wanted.
Christine Blake is not her real name.
She used to be a Russian special forces agent.
She defected,
and then changed her name and her face
and became a member of Lazarus.
She's been fully aware that in order for us to trust a spy like her,
she would have to be willing to put her life on the line.

------------ 크리스 구출 하러 가는 길 ----------
So we've made it to Oslo.
What are the next steps?

If we can make it to the northern coast of Norway,
then we should be able to go the rest of the way via ship.

No luck.
All flights are canceled because of the bad weather.

Can't drive there either,
apparently all the roads are closed down.

Now what?

We only have one day remaining.

[뚜르르르 전화소리]
Hersch?

Stay where you are.
U.S. European Command has dispatched a heli
to pick you up and get you as close as possible.
I also reached out to the Norwegian government.
They have a facility in Ny-Ålesund
that Elaina can use to work her computer magic.

So, we're good to go?

You'll be... outside of official protocol, of course.
And I don't want to lose Chris anymore than you.
I'm sorry to say it,
but this is the best I can do for you.

That's plenty.
We appreciate it.

------------ oil rig 침투 직전 ---------
Elaina, I'm assuming you can't get access.

The oil rig is completely offline,
but it's equipped with a communications system inside.
So once you turn that on, I should be able to access it.

I'm ready to go whenever you are.

The drone is ready, too.

Be very cautious when you enter Russian waters.
With all the ice sheets now melted,
military tensions around the Northern Arctic have been flaring up.
Worst case scenario, one misstep could trigger a world war.

------------ 잉가의 분노
Over the past three years,
all I could think about 
was when this time came
how I was going to kill you.

Go ahead and shoot.
I've always been willing to die by your hand.

Why should I believe you?
You're a no-good traitor!

When I saw you for the first time in three years,
I couldn't move.
I changed my face and even my name,
but the one thing that I couldn't change was my heart.

Then tell me.
Why did you just disappear?
You left me behind.

On that day, I was at the airport and died.
I actually flatlined and my name was on the casualty list.
But I survived.
That's when I thought if they all believe I'm dead
I can escape the agency.

And just... abandon me?

You were my handler.
They would kill you if I deserted.
That's why I needed to be dead.

It's all your fault.
Because of what you did, I can never love again.

[고문남 갑자기 끼어듦]
You're a traitor.
Traitors deserve to die!
[탕! 탕!]

Inga. Inga!

I'm glad I got to see you,
if it was only this one last time.
Go live your life for both of us...

Are you starting to remember how to be obedient?

Some tough guy you are,
Hitting a woman tied to chair.
