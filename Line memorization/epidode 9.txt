Sir, we greatly appreciate your continued patronage 
during these troubling times. 
However, I must ask. 
Are you really okay with only ordering the steak and nothing else on the menu? 

I require the precise intake of protein in order to maintain a peak physical condition. 
It's as simple as that. 
I'm done. 
See you tomorrow. 

-Thank you very much, sir.

You feeling okay? 

Yeah, I'm fine. 
Ow! 

You should get more rest. 

Thanks for having my back. 

The feeling's mutual. 

Where's Axel? 

He's out getting groceries with Doug. 

Has that cat always been here? 

Yeah. 
Although it hasn't cozied up to any of us. 

I guess since he's here 
he can be part of the team now.

Okay, let's go, I bought all they had in there. 

I've turned off the recorder, so our conversation won't be heard. 

Well, it's about time. 
You gonna ask me out on a date? 

[ Sighs ] 

That's the last thing I'd do, 
even if the world ended tomorrow. 

That sucks. 

What do you think? 

About what? 

Say we get our hands on Skinner, 
will we really get the freedom they promised us? 

Hard to say. 
Seems like we might know too many of their secrets. 

Exactly. 
And considering they went out of their way to make Lazarus a separate unit from the NSA... 

So once the job is done, they'll just erase us along with it. 

For once, I actually agree with you. 

That's sweet. 

And I'm pretty sure they're already trying to figure out exactly how much we know.
