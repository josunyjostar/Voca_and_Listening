-Hey,
come take a look at this.

-What is that?

Somebody prints on paper
in this day and age?

-It's a spirituality magazine

published 15 years ago.

There's an article in it
covering an MIT researcher

visiting a commune.

-Hm. He's kind of hot.

-That's Skinner.

-Huh?
-What?

-In his younger days.

-For real?
-"Despite his young age,

Dr. Skinner is known

for his numerous
scientific achievements.

And he was greatly impressed
by the commune's

philosophy after visiting."
There you have it.

-You trust what's
in this magazine?

-In any case,
the commune featured in it

still exists
as a religious organization.

It's called,
"Tower of the Truth."

-[ Gasps ]

Oh, it's nothing.

-This group enshrined
a post-singularity AI

as a superior being
and worships it as a god.

Apparently,
they believe

that since it is free
of human ego or desire,

it's perfect for a
modern-day deity.

-Mm?
-Uh, sounds kinda sketchy to me.

-They've cut themselves
off from society,

and are self-sufficient,
living off the land.

Isn't that
the perfect hideout?

Skinner could hide
from the world there.

-That idea's been tossed
around before, right?

-Betcha 10 bucks
Skinner isn't there.

-How 'bout 20 that he is?

-Come on, guys.
-Elaina.

Any chance you can get
access to their AI?

-Not possible.

Naga is completely disconnected
from the outside world.

-"Naga"?
-Uh...

That's the name of the AI.

-Hm?
Wait, how do you know that?

-Well...

that's where I grew up.

-What?

-Hm?

-Okay then, if we can't make
contact from outside,

then we'll have
to sneak in.

-Uh, well, if I pretend
to return as a believer,

they should welcome me back.

-By yourself?
-No way. Too dangerous.

Someone would need
to go with you.

-They'd be suspicious
of adult outsiders.

But a kid would be different.

-Huh?

♪♪

-Okay. We'll be stationed
at a nearby motel.

In the event you
actually find Skinner,

let us know immediately.

And if we don't hear from you
within 72 hours,

then we'll head in
for the rescue.

-Here. Take this with you.

-What is it?

-It's a smoke bomb.

Might come in handy.

-Wow, talk about
some old-school gear.

-Leland.
-Hm?

-Keep Elaina safe, okay?

-Well, yeah, of course I will.

-Elaina?

could you introduce me?

-Oh, this is Leon.

The outside world is full

-Goodness me.

Welcome home!

Elaina,
it's great to have you back.

And a hearty welcome to you,
new member of the family.

My name is Billy,

-Uh, okay.

-You arrived just in time
for the Holy Festival.

-Hey, Leon,
do you have anything else

that connects to the internet?

-Uh, no.

-Same for you, Elaina?
-Yeah.

The outside world is fraught
with false information.

And people get led astray
by it pretty quickly.

But don't worry.

Here, the almighty Naga
guides us in all ways.

-Really?
-Hopefully it won't take long

to undo the brainwashing
you suffered outside.

-Brainwashing, huh?

-Hey, Elaina.

-How is it?

-I can't even get
a satellite signal here.

-They must be jamming
everything.

-Yeah. Can you get me
a list of past MIT researchers?

-I'll try reaching out
to my contacts.

Also, it looks like the FBI
is starting to make some moves.

-Guess this is what
a turf war is like.

-Well, I'll be in touch

when I have a better idea
of what's going on.

-Copy that.

Hmm.

-No word from them yet, huh?

-We just have to have faith
and wait.

-[ Sighs ]
Do you think they're all right?

-They're members of Lazarus,
just like us.

You shouldn't be treating them
like little kids.

-I know, but still...

Looks like someone has ants
in his pants.

-[ Panting ]
-Talk about a waste of energy.

-So, hey.
-Hm?

-That lady from earlier
is your mom, right?

-Yeah.
-The two of you don't seem

particularly close.

-Everyone is treated
as one big family.

So any biological ties
are to be forgotten.

So we can't say things
like "Mom."

-That's messed up.

How does she feel about it?

To be honest...

their God is the only thing
she ever thinks about.

-What about your dad?

-I don't know who my father is.

-Really?

It's very odd, right?

But, you know, I went my whole
life thinking this was normal

since this was the only world
I knew.

Even so, it is weird, isn't it?

-Uh...
Uh, well...

-Around here,
we're entirely self-sufficient.

So tell me, what were
your lives on the outside like?

Unlike here, you have to have
money to live, right?

-Uh --
-Um, you see,

we worked part-time and stuff.

-That's right.

-What kind of job did you do?
-Uh...

-It's hard to explain.
We were paid to go find people.

That's where Elaina and I met,
actually.

-Wow. So was it a difficult job?

-Absolutely.

I got held up at gunpoint
by debt collectors,

chased around by thugs
from a gang,

forced to dress as a girl
and then got chased yet again.

Reflecting back
on all of it now,

it was a terrible workplace.

-Yeah, kinda.

-O' Holy Spirit,
endow us with your being.

Love Naga.

-Love Naga.
-Love Naga.

-Love Naga.
-Love Naga.

-Don't look at it
and just open your mouth.

It's proof of our bond.
Now swallow it.

[ Laughter and applause ]

-Attention, everyone,

Elaina and the new family member
that she brought along

shall receive a special blessing
at the Holy Festival

two days from now.

-I managed to dig up some intel
on Naga.

-So what is it?

-15 years ago,

MIT developed an AI meant
to imitate

the human neural network.

-Neural what now?

-It's based on our
central nervous system.

-Uh-huh.

-And the brain
they modeled it after

was someone heralded
as the next Einstein,

none other than Dr. Skinner.

-Whoa.

-They used it for an experiment

and programmed it
with a thirst for power

and a desire for control.

-And that became Naga?
-Exactly.

-Sounds like a disaster
in the making.

-One more thing,
seems the FBI has started

taking their own look
into the commune.

-Okay then,
Skinner must be there.

I really hope we can make
our move before they do.

-I've been looking all over,

but I haven't found
any traces of Skinner.

Which means it's time
for plan B.

We need to access Naga

and search
for any records related to him.

-Okay, then let's wait
for nightfall.

-Sounds good.

-Looks like your heart is
still full of sin.

-During tomorrow's
Holy Festival,

the two of you will represent
the sinful filth of this world,

so that the almighty Naga
can purify you.

-Bingo.

I got a list
of ex-MIT researchers.

Billy Perez is on it.

-Who's he?

-The leader of the commune.

Billy had such an obsession
with Naga

that he smuggled the
AI out of MIT,

founded his own cult,

and made it a god for people
to worship.

Then, he shut them off from all
contact with the outside world.

I suspect he's been using
the whole community as a tool

to feed Naga's desire
to dominate.

-Sounds like a playground
for a god.

-Okay, but, like,
isn't this Naga thing

just a copy of Skinner?

-Yeah, more or less.

-So then it's not a stretch
to think it'll try

to destroy the world just
like he did, right?

-Hmm.

-What do they really mean by
"Holy Festival" and "purifying"?

-We didn't have the Holy
Festival back when I was around,

but I'm familiar
with purification.

-They would take people away
and we never saw them again.

I thought they just got exiled,
but...

-Oh, no,
you don't think they --

-They're burned.
[ Both gasp ]

Those who are tainted have
their bodies purified by fire.

-You mean you guys are going to
burn us alive?

-Yes. At the Holy Festival, we
will watch you go up in flames.

And then we will all leave
our bodies behind

before this world
is consumed by sin.

All of us.
The entire commune family.

-[ Gasps ]
-That's insane.

-Hanna,
are you really okay with that?

Do you really think
you'll be happy

throwing away your life
because they tell you to?

-Elaina...

You know, I've always been
jealous of you.

I've gone my whole life
suppressing my feelings.

I chose to believe in Naga
and follow its instructions.

I shouldn't have any thoughts
of my own.

That's what I told myself.

But you were different.

[ Grunts ] Why'd you leave?

I hated you for being free
when I wasn't!

It's all I could think about.

-Hanna, come with us.

Let's leave together.

-You know that's impossible.

This is the only place
I've known my entire life.

How could I survive out there?

-I had feelings like yours,
too...

Everyone here acts the same.

They just reject
the outside world,

refusing to think
for themselves.

I was terrified at first, too.

If I can summon up the courage,
then so can you.

I don't think I'm wrong.
