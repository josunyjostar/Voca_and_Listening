I'm really thankful to him for one thing -
he helped me discover how courageous you are. 
While others were being cautious and reading the room, 
you had the guts to take that extra step. 
That was genuinely impressive. 

Like I've always said, you're perfect.
You are the most courageous and action-oriented woman I know.
you are Sophisticated,
Sincere,
Caring,
And you understand how important relationships really are.
Rather than having shallow connections with lots of people,
you know how to truly care for the ones closest to you.
That's who you are.

The problem was with him. Your way of approaching him was truly human and sincere

Are you up to going for a walk? 

you're the first one i have heard use the word click for kilometers.

-Settle down. 진정해

let on 
don't let on that you're disappointed.
실망했다는 것을 내색하지마

let on 
The rain hasn't let up all day.
비가 하루 종일 약해지지 않았다.
