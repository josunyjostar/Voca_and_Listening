-Okay, so how old are you, Chris? Maybe 30?
-Don't be stupid, I am not that old.
-Then 26 or 27?
-Nope. No comment.
Anything I say is just gonna let you narrow it down.
-You paused there for a second.
-That means he's probably right.
-I guess I better start using "ma'am" around you.
-Don't even think about it.
-Since we're sharing, I'm 16 years old.
-God, could you be any more annoying?
-Ow, ow. Cut it out.

I'm really thankful to him for one thing -
he helped me discover how courageous you are. 
While others were being cautious and reading the room, 
you had the guts to take that extra step. 
That was genuinely impressive. 

Like I've always said, you're perfect.
You are the most courageous and action-oriented woman I know.
you are Sophisticated,
Sincere,
Caring,
And you understand how important relationships really are.
Rather than having shallow connections with lots of people,
you know how to truly care for the ones closest to you.
That's who you are.

The problem was with him. Your way of approaching him was truly human and sincere

Are you up to going for a walk?

What's with the getup?

who is it you are again?

What kind of scheme are you up to this time?

Father went out of his way
to get you admitted into a good school, 
and you did nothing but screw it up!

Is it just me or do we seem sorely out of place here? 
I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't be here for this. 

Nobody gives a damn

What else was i supposed to do?

What life is really like for him - What is [무엇] like?" 매우 흔한 질문 패턴으로 연습

But then I figured there's no point in fighting the urge
when the world is about to end.

I had you figured out.

Your hunch was right on the money.

But the problem is we can never be sure what might happen
with an artificial heart.

Don't mention it. We scored big. 천만에 우린 큰 걸 얻었잖아.

-How will the end of the world come upon us?
It's something I've always wondered about ever since I was a kid...
Well, it arrived without warning, in a way nobody could have imagined.
About 4 years ago, a man named Dr. Skinner, 
one of the most brilliant minds since Einstein, 
developed a miracle painkiller known as "Hapna."
Since it was cheap and had no side effects, 
it dominated the market instantly, 
and the world became a Hapna-filled wonderland.
They said it freed people from all suffering 
and was even celebrated as "the drug that could save the world."
Then, 3 years ago, Dr. Skinner vanished without a trace... 
And as it turned out... Hapna was a grand trap that he set upon us all.

I wonder why is it that life always requires us to overcome 
so much grief, suffering, and all that other crap? 
Can't we just have fun and not have to deal with any of it? 
That's what was going through my head when first I heard about Hapna. 
So, obviously, I jumped on it. 
Some people said that it cured the pain of a heartbreak.
I thought, "That's weird." 
"How can a broken heart ever be painless?" 
"Isn't this too good to be true?" 
"What if I'm just being duped?" 
Those thoughts did cross my mind. 
Funny... It turns out that we were all being duped. 

-We're looking for a man named Claude. 
I was told he's been seen somewhere around this area recently.

-Someone must be hacking the surveillance systems... 

Are they replacing all the faces with his? 

-Yes... and it's being done with precision. 
They've altered the polygon masks, as well as the thermal imaging. 

-So what are you saying? 
Skinner is the one behind all this? 

No way... 

I'm only aware of three hackers... 
that can pull off a task like this... 

-And who are they? 

-Popcorn Wizard... Doctor 909... and Mad Screamer. 
Oh... that last one... is me. 

-Seriously? 

-There's a strong possibility, one of the other two hackers is helping Skinner out. 

-Elaina, can you find them? 

-I'm on it. 

-The surveillance cameras are no longer an option. 
But this does give us one clue. 
If Skinner has undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, 
there would be no need to do all of this. 

Which means? 

-That he's still somewhere out there... 
with the same face. 

-Correct.

-Listen. 
I'm a transgender woman with a record, who's also gone through bankruptcy. 
Around here, that's not an uncommon story. 
Some folks were happy to hear the world is ending... 
Even though you'll never hear them say it out loud. 
These people have circumstances that have led them here. 
So you have to understand that it's common courtesy not to go digging up anybody's past. 

-Well... 
Back when I was an academic researcher, a guy said to me... 
"There will never be a black Einstein." 
And that it was impossible for people like us to win a Nobel Prize... 
no matter how hard "we" tried. 
Unfortunately, I ended up hitting him... 
That man... was the dean of the university. 
I was kicked out of the academy for my actions, 
but Professor Claude stood up for me until the very end. 
And to this day... I have yet to thank him.

Comrade A, stand by on the east side!

Nobody gives a crap about your past.
*Nobody gives a damn (10화)

Over the past three years,
all I could think about 
was when this time came
how I was going to kill you.

Are you starting to remember how to be obedient?
Some tough guy you are,
Hitting a woman tied to chair.
